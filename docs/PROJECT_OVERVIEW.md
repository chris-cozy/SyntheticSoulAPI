# Project Overview

## What Synthetic Soul Is

Synthetic Soul is an experimental artificial intelligence project designed to simulate human-like emotions, thought patterns, and relationship dynamics. Its purpose is to create a digital mind that not only responds to user input but also develops an evolving personality, one that reflects emotional depth, personal biases, and individualized sentiments toward different users shaped by unique experiences.

The AI is named Jasmine, short for Just a Simulation Modeling Interactive Neural Engagement, to reflect both its experimental nature and its focus on simulating authentic engagement.

## Core Features

- Emotion simulation with decay, reinforcement, and contextual shifts
- Rich and Lite personality schemas for lightweight or deeper simulation
- Persistent memory and relationship context in MongoDB
- Autonomous thought generation independent of direct prompts
- Relationship dynamics that evolve based on interaction history
- Background processing with Redis + RQ for async task execution
- Structured response generation with OpenAI and DeepSeek integrations

## Philosophy

Synthetic Soul explores affective computing and digital companionship by blending AI with principles from psychology and relationship studies. The goal is not just interaction but evolution: an AI that grows and adapts over time based on context, continuity, and repeated user interactions.

## Scope and Direction

This project prioritizes:

- continuity across conversations, not one-off replies
- dynamic internal state, not static persona prompts
- clear API boundaries so UI and worker systems can evolve independently
- iterative experimentation while preserving production-safe defaults
